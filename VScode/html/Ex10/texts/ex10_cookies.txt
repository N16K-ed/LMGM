    Cookies INFO
    Cookies are small pieces of text sent to your browser by a website you visit. They help that website remember information about your 
    visit, which can both make it easier to visit the site again
    and make the site more useful to you. Similar technologies, 
    unique identifiers used to identify an app or
    device, pixel tags, and local storage, can perform the same 
    function. Cookies and similar technologies as described throughout 
    this page can be used for the purposes described below.
        
    Some cookies and similar technologies help sites and apps understand how their visitors 
    engage with their services. For example, Google Analytics uses a set of cookies to collect information on behalf of 
    businesses which use the Google Analytics service and report site usage statistics to them without personally identifying 
    individual visitors. ‘_ga’, the main cookie used by Google Analytics, enables the service to distinguish one visitor from
    another and lasts for 2 years. Any site that implements Google Analytics, including Google services, uses the ‘_ga’ cookie.
    Each ‘_ga’ cookie is unique to the specific property, so it cannot be used to track a given user or browser across unrelated 
    websites.

    Google services also use ‘NID’ and ‘_Secure-ENID’ cookies on Google Search, and ‘VISITOR_INFO1_LIVE’ and ‘__Secure-YEC’ 
    cookies on YouTube, for analytics. Google mobile apps may also use unique identifiers, such as the ‘Google Usage ID’, for analytics.
