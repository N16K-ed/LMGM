    <h1>Edsger Dijkstra´s Quotations</h1>

    <p class="intro">
      Edsger Wybe Dijkstra (1930 - 2002), 
      Dutch computer scientist and winner of the 1972 Turing, was a pioneer and champion of structured programming.
    </p>

    <p class="style-1">
      Object-oriented programming is an exceptionally 
      bad idea that can only originate in California.
    </p>

    <p class="style-2">
      If 10 years later when you're doing something fast and poorly done, you suddenly feel I'm looking at what you're doing and you say to yourself, "This
      Dijkstra wouldn't have liked this," well, I'll settle for that kind of immortality.
    </p>

    <p class="style-3">
      Computer science does not deal with computers any more than
       astronomy deals with telescopes. 
    </p>

    <p class="style-1">
      Self-improvement is as much about learning as it is about relearning.
    </p>

    <p class="style-2">
      Wondering whether a computer thinks is as 
      interesting as wondering whether a submarine swims.
    </p>

    <p class="style-3">
      The mission of the University is not to offer what society asks for,
       but to provide what society needs.
